//! Facility abstractions for the HAL.
//!
//! A "facility" is a capability exposed by a device: geometry, hardware
//! identification, streams, decoders, ROI control, trigger control, and so on.
//! A device is represented as a registry rather than a single trait object. It is a
//! registry of individually typed capability objects.
//!
//! The pieces fit together like this:
//!
//! - `FacilityType` names the capability the caller wants.
//! - `FacilityHandle` stores the concrete trait object behind that capability.
//! - `Device::get_facility` returns the handle.
//! - `TryFrom<FacilityHandle>` converts the handle into the exact trait-object
//!   alias expected by the caller.
//! - `BaseFacility` provides `Any`-based downcasting when a mutable handle must
//!   be recovered as a concrete type.
//!
//! This design models heterogeneous hardware while keeping call sites explicit
//! about ownership, mutability, and thread-safety.
