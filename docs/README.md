# OpenEVT plugin development

OpenEVT plugins are dynamic Rust libraries that connect the host crate to an
event source or an event visualization pipeline. This book documents the
contracts in this repository, the ABI rules behind them, and the workflow for
building a plugin that another OpenEVT application can discover and load.

There are two independent plugin families:

| Plugin | Input | Output | ABI root |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Device plugin | A camera, file, simulator, or network source | Device metadata, facilities, and CD/trigger batches | `openevt_device_plugin` |
| Frame generator | Decoded `EventCD` batches | Caller-owned RGBA image buffers | `frame_generator_plugin` |

Start with [Architecture and mental model](architecture.md), then choose the
[device plugin](plugin-development-guide.md) or
[frame-generation plugin](framegen-plugin.md) guide. The
[video simulator](simulator-plugin.md) is a complete working device plugin
that is especially useful when implementing a new adapter.

## Repository map

The root `openevt` crate owns the public HAL and both ABI contracts. The
`openevt-plugins` crate contains a video-backed simulator and optional Python
bindings. The raw-file device adapter lives in `src/devices/raw/plugin.rs`.

The contracts are deliberately small. Keep vendor SDKs, decoders, threads,
channels, locks, and mutable buffers inside the plugin; only ABI-safe values
cross the dynamic-library boundary.

## Compatibility rule

Build the plugin and host against compatible versions of `openevt`,
`abi_stable`, and the Rust ABI definitions. A plugin is not a generic shared
object: it must export the exact root-module contract expected by the loader.
